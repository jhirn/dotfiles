# Dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles I've used since 2010, excluding emacs (which I no longer use).

## Note

Feel free to crib individual files but the installation is a bit wonky due to a security patch for MacOS no longer allowing symlinks to `~/Library` directories, effectively [breaking Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/1924). I'll be converting to something else so my shell scripts can be edited in one place and symlinked and use something else to manage applicaiton backup and MacOS settings. For now I use mackup to copy files here and then uninstall mackup to replace links with hard copies with

```
mackup backup --force && mackup uninstall
```
